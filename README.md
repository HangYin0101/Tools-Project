# Game description

Greedy snake is a game which was first invented in mid 70s, and it became trending because it adapts the small screen (4.0 sqr inch)phones in early 90s.

Nowadays, the Greedy snakes becomes a common name of video games that players control a line which grows in length. The Greedy snake could be installed in most phones, with variations in versions.


# Greedy Snake Game

While playing the game, players manipulate a long, thin string, we call it snake. The snake keeps moving, with changing in directions to pick up the "apples". Direction changing is controlled by players with "up", "down", "left", and "right" key on the keyboard. Every time the snake successfully picked up an "apple", the snake will grow longer by one unit. When pressing the space key, it can accelerate to make the game more exciting. At the same time, players need to be careful with touching the walls and its body.
