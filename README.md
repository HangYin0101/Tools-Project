# Game description 

Greedy snake is a game which was first invented in mid 70s, and it becames trending because it adapts the small screen (4.0 sqr inch)phones in early 90s. 

Nowadays, the Greedy snakes becomes a common name of vedio games that players control a line which grows in length. The Greedy snake could be installed in most phones, with variations in versions.


# Greedy Snake Game

While playing the game, players manipulate a long, thin string, we call it snake. The snake keeps moving, with changing in dirctions to pick up the "apples". Direction changing is controlled by players with up, down, left, and righht key on the keyboard. Everytime the snake sucessfully picked up an "apple", the snake will grow longer by one unit. At the same time, players need to be careful with touching the walls and its body.
